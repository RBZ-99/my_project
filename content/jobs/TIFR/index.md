- Worked in Game Theory to develop a cake-cutting algorithm to solve the problem of fair resource allocation. It works for any number of agents, and allows for arbitrary valuations over the cake.
- The allocation resulting from the algorithm ensures an envy-freeness restricted to any arbitrarily small number epsilon. It further ensures that either the resource (cake) gets exhausted, or all the agents get their share
